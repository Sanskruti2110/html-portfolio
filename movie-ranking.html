<h3>Animal</h3>

<p>"Animal" a movie from which i expected a lot (as people were saying its going to change indian cinema) It is a nice movie you can go to thetere grab some popcorns enjoy the first half with brilliant BGM, Action And ranbir kapoor's amazing acting skills that Adranline rush just amazing the story was also going nice. As the second half starts the action starts fading away and people starts having full conversion that you barely see in first half Some of the dilogues in the movie are very nicely written medical terms used very aptly that dilogue about swastik and Nazi symbol (detailing)Amazing!!
